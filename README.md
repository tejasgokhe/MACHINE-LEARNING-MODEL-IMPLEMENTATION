##DESCRIPTION:-
Machine Learning Model Implementation
In this project, we implemented a Machine Learning model to solve a real-world classification problem using the Scikit-learn library in Python. The goal was to train the model on historical data and make predictions on new, unseen data.

Steps Followed:
1)Data Collection- We used a dataset relevant to our project (e.g., SMS Spam Detection). It was loaded using Pandas for processing.
2)Data Preprocessing
3)Cleaned and formatted the data.
4)Converted categorical values to numerical.
5)Applied tokenization and vectorization (for text data).
6)Splitting the Dataset- The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate model performance.
7)Model Selection and Training
8)Used Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) as our classification algorithm.
9)The model was trained using the training dataset.
10)Model Evaluation- Evaluated the trained model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
11)Visualized performance using Seaborn heatmap for better understanding.
12)Model Saving and Deployment
13)Saved the trained model using joblib- This makes it reusable for future predictions without retraining.

Technologies Used:
1)Python
2)Pandas, NumPy – for data handling
3)Scikit-learn – for ML model
4)Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualization

Platform used:- Visual Studio Code
